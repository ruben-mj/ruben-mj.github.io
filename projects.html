                                        <p>This was part of the programme at HAST. In Flemish it is referred to as GIP or "Geïntegreerde Proef".
                                            Part of the GIP is an internship of a mere 2 weeks in a company of choice, in which the student is given several tasks to complete within those 2 weeks.</p><p>
                                        During the internship reports have to be written analysing, executing and reflecting on said tasks.
                                        After the 2 weeks timeperiod a document must be put together including all reports and extra information concerning the internship.
                                        The last step was a presentation before a "GIP-committee"(mostly teachers & mentors). <br>
                                        I've decided to make the finished documents public for students that need a lead or curious potential employers, both the document and the presentation. <br>
                                        <br>NOTE: All documents are Flemish! The button below will take you to my cloud.<br></p>

                                        <p>Due to Covid-19 many non-profits had to cease their actions in order to comply to the measures set by the Belgian government.
                                            A local team of volunteers in my town organise an annual fair-trade breakfast to support <a href="https://broederlijkdelen.be/nl">Broederlijk Delen</a>'s actions in the South.
                                            Covid-19 was still raging in our area and gatherings of 5+ people were illegal. The breakfast, usually held in a big hall accommodating +-100 people, was not an option.
                                            By setting up a simple webshop for them using <a href="https://www.mijnwebwinkel.nl/">mijnwebwinkel</a> I was able to set up, automate and transform their breakfast into a takeaway breakfast.<br>
                                            They are considering opening the takeaway annually as an additional option.

                                            Since the start of 2020 I've been active on my neighbourhoods <a href="https://www.hoplr.com/">Hoplr</a>. Via Hoplr I provide accessible and affordable digital support for anyone who needs it.
                                            During the Covid period many preferred at-home service. It usually involves elderly people having small digital struggles.
                                            This mostly includes but is not limited to:

                                            More advanced support is also possible.
                                            People wanting to open a website, improve their social media activities and looking to market their business have approached me.
                                            Even though marketing isn't the main purpose of my service, I was still able to help them create and publish several successful adverts.
                                            I also provide full social media and website maintenance for a small monthly payment.
